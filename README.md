## Who Is This For?
Usually, discord server owners.

## What Can These Be Used For?
This is usually useful for Discord bots with a domain blocker, so if someone tries to use an IP logger, the bot will delete the link and preform administrative action.

## Does This List Include All Ip Loggers?
No, it only includes the decently known ones as there are too much on the web to block.
