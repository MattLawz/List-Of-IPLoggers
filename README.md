## Who Is This For?
Usually discord server owners, and website developers.

## Why To use This
- Keep your users safe
- Block malicous attacks
- Abide by [Discords TOS](https://discord.com/terms)
- Have a more advanced auto-mod

## What Can These Be Used For?
This is usually useful for Discord bots with a domain blocker, so if someone tries to use an IP logger, the bot will delete the link and preform administrative action.

## What Discord Bot Can Use Something Like This?
A good one is [Carl Bot](https://carl.gg/), all you need to do is login to your Carl Bot web panel then go to the auto mod section on the left, then put the domains in the "bad links" section.

## Does This List Include All Ip Loggers?
No, it only includes the decently known ones as there are too much on the web to block.
